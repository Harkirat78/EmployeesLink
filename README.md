# Employee Tracker - Advanced Linked List

This C program, "Employee Tracker," demonstrates the implementation of an advanced linked list for managing employee data. The project leverages the power of dynamic data structures in C to create a flexible and efficient system for handling employee information.

## Features

Linked List Operations: The program utilizes a linked list to manage and organize employee records efficiently.
Command Line Interface: Designed for the Unix/Linux command line terminal, providing a seamless and intuitive experience for users.
Stacks/Queues Implementation: The project incorporates the concept of stacks/queues for specific tasks, enhancing the functionality of the employee tracking system.

## What I Learned

Linked List: Gain hands-on experience in implementing and managing linked lists in a real-world application.
Unix/Linux Terminal: Develop proficiency in building and interacting with programs in the Unix/Linux command line environment.
Data Structure Concepts: Understand and apply advanced data structure concepts such as stacks and queues in practical scenarios.
C Programming: Enhance C programming skills through the development of a robust and functional employee tracking system.
This project serves as a valuable learning experience, combining theoretical knowledge with practical implementation in the realm of data structures and system programming.

## Usage

Compile: Compile the program using a C compiler.
bash
Copy code
gcc employee_tracker.c -o employee_tracker
Execute: Run the compiled program.
bash
Copy code
./employee_tracker
