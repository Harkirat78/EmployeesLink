/*
this function allows the user to manually enter the
employee data from standard input and add their information to the end of the linked list
passed as a parameter to this function. The user enters the fname, lname of the employee. It
then prompts to enter the dependent names one by one

Function name: recruitEmployee
Inputs: struct
Returns: void
